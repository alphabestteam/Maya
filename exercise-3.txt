1. NodePort, is the key of putting the application in the world. It is a type of services and it opens a port for every node 
in the cluster, and so all the traffic that is sent to port is forwarded to the service. However, we usually won't use it in production 
because it is not secure, and instead we will use Ingress, which is an object in k8s. 
2. kubectl apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml   // saving the changes I made in the deployments for the nodePort to work
kubectl apply -f backend-deployment.yaml  
kubectl expose service frontend-service --type=NodePort // we add the type NodePort to the service of the frontend
minikube service frontend-service -n my-first-namespace // we activate the application
