1. version: The version of the compose file.
services: In this field all the containers that are being used in this compose are being written. 
mongo /mongo-express: name of the services and in these fields the containers' info are written.
image: image name
container_name: container name
environment: This field is for environment variables. In this field you set the environment variables.
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: it is used for mongo db for initializing a root user.
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: it is used with mongo db for setting password for root user.
ports: the port that is being used with the container the first part of the port is on the host machine, and the second port is on
the container. 
volumes: a field that defines the volumes for the services in the application.
type: defines the type of volume that is being used.
source: the directory on the host machine. used for connecting the host machine to container.
target: the directory on the container.
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: environment variable for Mongo Express it is used for defining a username of the administrative user that Mongo Express
will use to connect to the MongoDB instance.
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD:It is a environment variable for Mongo Express that defines a password for username.
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: environment variable for Mongo Express that defines the address for the mongo db server that Mongo Express will connect to when running Docker container.
ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_PORT: the port of MongoDB.
MONGO_DATA/ MONGO_CONFIG: environment variable that we define and can use in volumes.

2. The error is that even though it says docker compose is running, you can't connect to it on http://localhost:8081/. That is because we didn't add port 8081 in the mongo express service, so it doesn't know 
on which port to connect on.

3. The solution is to add ports field to Mongo Express with the ports of 8081.

4. docker-compose down

part b:

1. An easier way and cleaner way to create environment variables is with a file called .env file which in that file you add all of the environment variables and then
in the docker-compose.yml file you just refer to the .env file.
3. docker-compose up
