-----------DOCKER HELLO WORLD!-------------
1. Docker is a technology that is used by developers in order to create, run, and manage 
applications in containers. Docker helps making simpler the process of running applications, it helps
the developers build software in ab better more efficient way.
2. Docker image is the structure for the container, it tells docker how the container needs to look like.
It has in it the information of how the container will run. To create a docker image first you
need to create a Dockerfile, which you write all the commands (instructions) that will create the container when you run it.
Then you need to build the docker image using docker build, it reads the instruction from the Dockerfile and
creates a docker image. Then you run the command docker run <app-name> which will run the docker image
and will create the docker container with the instructions of the image.
3. The docker container is created with the instructions of the docker image when you run the command docker run.
 It is a machine that runs on the operating system and it acts like a server and we can communicate it as any other server.
4. The difference is that docker image is the instructions and container is the actual product that is created out of those
instructions.
5. environment variable is a flag when configuring the container, this flag allows you to give the application dynamic values
at the runtime. 
6. volume is the communication between the folder on the local machine to the folder in the container. so if for example
you want to get something from local machine to the container you can do that easily with volumes.
